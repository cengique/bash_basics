# Katrina's added Notes:
# String comparison
# Str1 == Str2, Str1 != Str2, (can also use 1 `=` equals sign instead of 2
# -n Str  Returns true if the string is not null
# -z Str  Returns true if the string is null
# The use of a space after the `[` and befor the `]` is necessary,
# Otherwis you will git `[strVar: command not found]`
